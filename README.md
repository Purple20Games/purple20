# Purple20

Purple20 is a Chrome extension that supports integration of the DCC Crawler Companion with the Roll20 virtual table top, allowing:

* Rolls made in Crawler Companion (simple rolls, fumbles, crits, etc) will appear in Roll20 chat
* 0-level characters generated through Crawler Companion can automatically be created as character sheets in Roll20 (also requires the 'P20_Bot' Roll20 API script, available at https://github.com/Purple20Games/roll20_api)

### Installation
Install via the Chrome store at https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fhefaendccigncfdkfjcaklophndhkkd

### Usage
* Install the extension
* Navigate to Crawler Companion (be sure you're online and broadcasting)
* In a separate tab, navigate to Roll20 and enter a game
* Confirm that the Purple 20 extension shows the status of both as "connected"
* Roll dice in Crawler Companion -- the rolls should appear in Roll20
