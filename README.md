# Purple20

Purple20 is a Chrome extension that supports integration of the DCC Crawler Companion with the Roll20 virtual table top, allowing:

* Rolls made in Crawler Companion (simple rolls, fumbles, crits, etc) will appear in Roll20 chat
* 0-level characters generated through Crawler Companion can automatically be created as character sheets in Roll20 (also requires the 'P20_Bot' Roll20 API script)

### Installation
